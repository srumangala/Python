Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian 
tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. This remarkable longevity is due to 
honey's low water content and acidic pH, which create an e nvironment that inhibits the growth of 
microorganisms. Honey's natural composition also makes it an effective wound healer and cough 
suppressant. Its unique ability to resist spoilage has made it a symbol of immortality in various 
cultures throughout histo ry, and it continues to be a fascinating example of nature's preservation 
powers today.
