The Eiffel Tower Can Be 15 cm Taller During the Summer  
 
Due to the expansion of iron when exposed to heat, the Eiffel Tower, made primarily of iron, can 
actually grow taller during the summer months. When the temperature rises, the iron structure 
expands, causing the tower to increase in height by up to 15 cent imeters (about 6 inches). This 
expansion is temporary and reversible; as the temperature drops in the cooler months, the tower 
contracts back to its original height. This fascinating phenomenon is a testament to the effects of 
thermal expansion on large me tal structures and is a quirky detail about one of the world's most 
iconic landmarks.
